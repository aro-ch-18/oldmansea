<span id="t3_12" class="t s2_12">- 11 - </span>
<span id="t4_12" class="t s3_12">I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today Iâ€™ll work out </span>
<span id="t5_12" class="t s3_12">where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. </span>
<span id="t6_12" class="t s3_12">Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait </span>
<span id="t7_12" class="t s3_12">was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were </span>
<span id="t8_12" class="t s3_12">down in the blue </span>
<span id="t9_12" class="t s3_12">water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait </span>
<span id="ta_12" class="t s3_12">hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and </span>
<span id="tb_12" class="t s3_12">all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh </span>
<span id="tc_12" class="t s3_12">sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on </span>
<span id="td_12" class="t s3_12">the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was </span>
<span id="te_12" class="t s3_12">not sweet smelling and good tasting. </span>
<span id="tf_12" class="t s3_12">The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two </span>
<span id="tg_12" class="t s3_12">deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow </span>
<span id="th_12" class="t s3_12">jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the </span>
<span id="ti_12" class="t s3_12">excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a </span>
<span id="tj_12" class="t s3_12">big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait </span>
<span id="tk_12" class="t s3_12">would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made </span>
<span id="tl_12" class="t s3_12">fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three </span>
<span id="tm_12" class="t s3_12">hundred fathoms of line. </span>
<span id="tn_12" class="t s3_12">Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed </span>
<span id="to_12" class="t s3_12">gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite </span>
<span id="tp_12" class="t s3_12">light and any moment now the sun would rise. </span>
<span id="tq_12" class="t s3_12">The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on </span>
<span id="tr_12" class="t s3_12">the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was </span>
<span id="ts_12" class="t s3_12">brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back </span>
<span id="tt_12" class="t s3_12">at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down </span>
<span id="tu_12" class="t s3_12">into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. </span>
<span id="tv_12" class="t s3_12">He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the </span>
<span id="tw_12" class="t s3_12">stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that </span>
<span id="tx_12" class="t s3_12">swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty </span>
<span id="ty_12" class="t s3_12">fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. </span>
<span id="tz_12" class="t s3_12">But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who </span>
<span id="t10_12" class="t s3_12">knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather </span>
<span id="t11_12" class="t s3_12">be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. </span>
<span id="t12_12" class="t s3_12">The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look </span>
<span id="t13_12" class="t s3_12">into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far </span>
<span id="t14_12" class="t s3_12">inshore. </span>
<span id="t15_12" class="t s3_12">All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the </span>
<span id="t16_12" class="t s3_12">evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the </span>
<span id="t17_12" class="t s3_12">evening too. But in the morning it is painful. </span>
<span id="t18_12" class="t s3_12">Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky </span>
<span id="t19_12" class="t s3_12">ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then </span></div>
